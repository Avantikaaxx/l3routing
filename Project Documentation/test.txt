1. Testing and Debugging for the L3Routing Application: (Screenshots in the Report)

A) We test our code by sending traffic between various hosts in the network(mininet’s built-in)topology.
We used the pingall command.

b)To further debug our application, we view the contents of an SDN switch’s flow tables by running the following command in your mininet VM.

sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1

This will output the contents of s1’s flow tables. 

c)Moreover we can debug the application by triggering EventHandlers
Triggering Event Handlers
We trigger the linkDiscoveryUpdate(...) event handler by running any of the following commands in mininet:
link s1 s2 down — takes down the link between s1 and s2; you can assume the network is a connected graph, so you should never take down a link that would result in a disconnected graph
link s1 s2 up  — brings up the link between s1 and s2
link s1 h1 down  — takes down the link between s1 and h1; this will also result in a deviceRemoved(...) event and the isAttachedToSwitch() method for the Host object for h1 will now return false
link s1 h1 up  — brings up the link between s1 and h1; this will also result in a deviceMoved(...) event and the isAttachedToSwitch() method for the Host object for h1 will now return true
We can trigger the deviceRemoved(...) event handler by taking down a link between a switch and a host, as described above
We can trigger the deviceMoved(...) event handler by bringing up a link between a switch and a host, as described above
we can trigger the switchRemoved(...) event handler by running the following command in a regular terminal window (not in mininet):
  udo ovs-vsctl del-br s1
Note that once a switch is removed, you cannot easily add it back without restarting mininet. 

2. Testing and Debugging the LoadBalancer:

We test your code by issuing web requests (using curl) from a client host to the virtual IPs.
To see which packets a host is sending/recieving we use the following command:
tcpdump -v -n -i hN-eth0
Note: N denotes the host’s number.
